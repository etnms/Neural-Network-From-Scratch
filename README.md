# Neural Network From Scratch 

## Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to create neural network from scratch in python (no library like Tensorflow or PyTorch). The main idea behind the project was for me to get get a deeper understanding of neural networks.

## Features
- Layers and activation functions (relu, softmax, tanh, sigmoid)
- Dropout layers
- Modular layer creation
- Split train/test sets
- Early stopping
- Weight initialization
- Save/load a model
- Some functions for data conversion and preprocessing

## Data
The network can read and learn with .csv files.

## Languages and libraries
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- PyQt6 (GUI interface)
